# tecs-starter

A larger reference game for [Tecs](https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs), a
high-performance ECS framework for building Love2D games in Teal.

## Install Tecs CLI

The Tecs CLI is the only required installation. It includes Teal, Tecs/Tecs2D,
type declarations, and build tooling, and downloads a tested LÖVE 12 runtime
on first use. Lua, LuaRocks, and a compiler toolchain are not required.

### macOS and Linux

```bash
brew install tecs-dev/tap/tecs-cli
```

### Windows

```powershell
scoop bucket add tecs https://github.com/tecs-dev/scoop-bucket
scoop install tecs
```

Open a new terminal after installation.

### Standalone installers

Prefer not to use a package manager?

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
irm https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs-cli/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Run This Reference Game

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs-starter.git my-game
cd my-game
tecs run
```

`tecs run` prepares the embedded dependencies, downloads LÖVE 12 into the user
cache when needed, builds the game, and launches the scrolling shooter demo.

For a small new project instead of this larger example, run `tecs new my-game`.

## Build Targets

| Command              | Description                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `tecs run`           | Build and run the game (runs setup automatically)    |
| `tecs build`         | Compile without running                              |
| `tecs check`         | Type-check all Teal source files (`--json` for tooling) |
| `tecs add <rock>`    | Vendor a pure-Lua rock and its Teal types from luarocks.org |
| `tecs remove <rock>` | Remove a vendored rock                               |
| `tecs update`        | Update vendored rocks to their newest versions       |
| `tecs clean`         | Remove build artifacts                               |
| `tecs info`          | Show CLI/runtime versions and project status (`--json` for tooling) |
| `tecs agent`         | List bundled agent guides or print one's installed path |
| `tecs completions`   | Print a bash, zsh, or fish completion script         |

## Hot Reload

The reference game enables Tecs2D's snapshot-preserving hot reload by default. Run the
game normally:

```bash
tecs run
```

Then, from another terminal, rebuild whenever you want to reload code/assets:

```bash
tecs build
```

On a successful build, the task runner updates `build/.tecs-reload-stamp`. The
running game polls that single stamp file and restarts Love2D with freshly
loaded modules.

The demo restores the saved ECS snapshot after restart. Tecs2D rebuilds
renderer-owned sprite buckets and physics bodies from durable components during
normal startup/update; the demo also rebinds its local HUD and player references
after `FinishSnapshotLoad`.

You can wire any external watcher to the same stamp convention. The important
rule is to touch the stamp only after a successful rebuild:

```bash
watchexec -w src -w assets 'tecs build'
```

## Demo Controls

The reference demo is a small scrolling shooter:

- **Arrow keys / WASD** - Move the player
- **Space** - Fire
- **Enter** - Start, pause, resume, or restart depending on state
- **ESC** - Quit
- **Ctrl+.** - Toggle stats overlay
- **Ctrl+/** - Toggle the runtime debugger

The camera stays fixed while the playfield scrolls. Enemies, asteroids, powerups,
pause/game-over overlays, and a periodic glitch storm are implemented as Tecs plugins and systems.
