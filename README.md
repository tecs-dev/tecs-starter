# tecs-starter

A project template for building Love2D games with [Tecs](https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs),
a high-performance ECS framework.

## Prerequisites

Install [`tecs-cli`](https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs-cli). It downloads a
tested LÖVE 12 runtime on first use; LuaJIT, LuaRocks, and a compiler toolchain
are not required.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tecs-dev/tecs-starter.git my-game
cd my-game
tecs run
```

That's it! The first command downloads LÖVE 12 into the user cache. The
headless CLI payload already contains Teal, Tecs/Tecs2D, type declarations, and
the starter toolchain. You should see a scrolling shooter demo.

## Build Targets

| Command             | Description                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `tecs run`         | Build and run the game (runs setup automatically)    |
| `tecs build`       | Compile without running                              |
| `tecs check`       | Type-check all Teal source files                     |
| `tecs clean`       | Remove build artifacts                               |
| `tecs love12`      | Re-download Love2D 12                                |

## Hot Reload

The template enables Tecs2D's snapshot-preserving hot reload by default. Run the
game normally:

```bash
tecs run
```

Then, from another terminal, rebuild whenever you want to reload code/assets:

```bash
tecs build
```

On a successful build, the task runner updates `build/.tecs-reload-stamp`. The
running game polls that single stamp file and restarts Love2D with freshly
loaded modules.

The starter restores the saved ECS snapshot after restart. Tecs2D rebuilds renderer-owned sprite buckets and physics bodies from durable components during normal startup/update; the starter also rebinds its local HUD and player references after `FinishSnapshotLoad`.

You can wire any external watcher to the same stamp convention. The important
rule is to touch the stamp only after a successful rebuild:

```bash
watchexec -w src -w assets 'tecs build'
```

## Managing Dependencies

The generated game uses LÖVE's LuaJIT runtime and its bundled modules. Place
additional pure-Lua modules under `src/vendor/share/lua/5.1`; `tecs build`
copies runtime modules into the self-contained build output.

## Demo Controls

The starter demo is a small scrolling shooter:

- **Arrow keys / WASD** - Move the player
- **Space** - Fire
- **Enter** - Start, pause, resume, or restart depending on state
- **ESC** - Quit
- **Ctrl+.** - Toggle stats overlay
- **Ctrl+/** - Toggle the runtime debugger

The camera stays fixed while the playfield scrolls. Enemies, asteroids, powerups,
pause/game-over overlays, and a periodic glitch storm are implemented as Tecs plugins and systems.
